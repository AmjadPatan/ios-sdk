##Building a Seismograph App with CoreMotion, Swift and Telerik UI for iOS

Data visualizations are important, especially on small screen areas, where Excel files or other tables are difficult to read and comprehend. Visualizations are even more important when you add the various sensors that an iPhone device offers, not to mention the different certified third-party devices. Today, I will show you how you can set up the Telerik Chart for iOS to live-stream the data coming from the accelerometer sensor using the CoreMotion API.

The Chart will visualize the changes in phone acceleration in all three directions (X, Y or Z), depending on which direction the user has chosen. For more information on how the project is created, please refer to the following blog article: [Building a Seismograph App with CoreMotion, Swift and Telerik UI for iOS](http://blogs.telerik.com/iosteam/posts/15-01-07/building-a-seismograph-app-with-coremotion-swift-and-telerik-ui-for-ios)

Note that in order to build the project, you need [Telerik UI for iOS](http://www.telerik.com/ios-ui).
